The image above is a perfect representation of the architecture and process I ued when deploying the architecture. The application is a simple CRUD application written in JAVA. The CRUD activities is being performed on the MySQL database. 

To deploy this application, ensure that you have AWS CLI and Terraform installed on the host machine. Follow the steps below to deploy the application.

1. Navigate to the Terraform directory

```
cd terraform
```

2. Initialize terraform

```
terraform init
```

3. Apply Terraform code

```
terraform apply
```

4. The previous command will create the eks cluster and the msql database. Next is to push an image to the ECR repository created. The url is in the terraform outputs

```
# build the image
docker build -t <ecr-image> .
```

5. Configure kubectl 

```
aws eks --region us-west-2 update-kubeconfig --name Prophious-Project
```

Apply the applications configuration and pods

```
kubectl apply -f .
```

The kubenetes archtecture creates a service account and configures a service provider created by terraform. This is needed for the pods to safely get the database password and username from the secret manager.
